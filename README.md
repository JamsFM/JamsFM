- 👋 Hello, I’m *James Frank Mare`* (@JamsFM) a Software Developer who graduated with a **B.S. in Computer Engineering & Systems** from **University of Washington Tacoma** (GPA: 3.35 ~ June, 2021).
- Most Pertanant Work History:
  - **Software Development Engineer (*Enrollment/Middleware*)**
    
    **@ Cambia Health Solutions (*Regence Insurance/BlueShield/BlueCross*)**
    
    [*Apr 4, 2022 – Jan 24, 2025*]
		
    **Description**:
    - Modernized data processing in various *Directory Maintenance* jobs by consolidating and migrating DataStage jobs to Python, significantly improving efficiency and *freeing up Developer time*. Also migrated an *Enrollment Channel ETL* process across three separate jobs, which involved extracting data from *834 CSV files*, applying complex business logic *transformations*, and *loading* the results into an *On-prem database* for use by an internal admin website.
    - I actively participated in daily Scrums and led *Backlog Refinement* sessions using Jira. 
    - I also shared *On-Call* responsibilities, including weekends and holidays, responding to production incidents via *Remedy tickets* and escalating issues as needed.
    - I contributed to planning for major system upgrades, ensuring minimal disruption to job processing. Throughout the development lifecycle, I was involved in *design*, *development*, *test case* design, *documentation*, Jenkins *builds/deployments*, *scheduling*, *testing*, *production release*, and ongoing *monitoring* and *support*.

- 👀 I’m interested in obtaining a full-time position *Remotely* or *On-Site* in the state of Washington. *Hybrid* would also be appealing if, again, in Washington. 
  - **Job positions I could fill are:** <br />
  Software Developer Engineer (Frontend/Backend), Full Stack Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Software System Designer, Data Engineer, Embedded Systems Engineer
  - **I’m looking to collaborate on anything relating to the following:** <br />
  Frontend/Backend, Testing/Quality, API, Cloud Computing, FPGA
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Web Developement. My most recent endevour has been to create my own corner of the internet where I could display my efforts towards creating a Portfolio Website using *React* while also keeping me comfortable with *HTML, CSS, & JavaScript* in their own uses. Besides this personal project, I have also been further familiarizing myself with *cloud computing & containerization*. Partially from the HomeLab projects I've been giving myself, but also in an endevour to keep my sponge of a brain ever occupied.
