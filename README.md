- 👋 Hello, I’m *James Frank Mare`* (@JamsFM) a Software Developer who graduated with a **B.S. in Computer Engineering & Systems** from **University of Washington Tacoma** (GPA: 3.35 ~ June, 2021).
- Most Pertanant Work History:
  - **Software Development Engineer (*Enrollment/Middleware*)**
    
    **@ Cambia Health Solutions (*Regence Insurance/BlueShield/BlueCross*)**
    
    [*Apr 4, 2022 – Jan 24, 2025*]
		
    **Description**:
    - Modernized data processing in various *Directory Maintenance* jobs by consolidating and migrating DataStage jobs to Python, significantly improving efficiency. Also migrated an *Enrollment Channel ETL* process across three separate jobs, which involved *extracting* data from *834 CSV files*, applying complex business logic *transformations*, and *loading* the results into an *On-prem database* for use by an internal admin website. Refining logs and result-emails for jobs, updating and creating documentation for processes, and reducing developer workload overall.	
	- Migrated a complex *Enrollment Channel ETL process* spanning three separate jobs, extracting data from *834 CSV files*, applying insurance enrollment business logic transformations, and loading the results into a database for internal administrative use.	
	- Actively participated in and led Agile methodologies like *Daily Scrums*, *Backlog Refinement* sessions, *Sprint Planning*, *Retrospective*, *Showcases/Demos*, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to drive Sprint goals.	
	- Took on *On-Call* responsibilities, including weekends and holidays, addressing production incidents via *Remedy tickets*, personally troubleshooting issues, and escalating problems as needed during my rotation.
	- Contributed to the planning and executing of major *On-prem System Upgrades*, ensuring minimal disruption to job processing and maintaining high system availability.
	- Played a key role throughout the development lifecycle, I was involved in *Design*, *Development*, *Test Case* Design, *Documentation*, Jenkins *Builds/Deployments*, *Scheduling*, *Testing*, *Production Release*, and ongoing *Monitoring* and *Support*.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Web Developement. My most recent endevour has been to create my own corner of the internet where I could display my efforts in creating a Portfolio Website using *React*, while also keeping comfortable with *HTML, CSS, & JavaScript*. Besides this personal project, I have also been further familiarizing myself with *cloud computing & containerization*. Partially from the HomeLab projects I've been giving myself, but also in an endevour to keep my sponge of a brain ever occupied.
